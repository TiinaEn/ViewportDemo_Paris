    <h1>Useful Tips</h1>
    <h3>Paris isn’t as expensive as everyone thinks</h3>
    <p>Before going to Paris friends were warning me that the city was going to destroy my wallet and almost every person on any travel forum was telling
        me the same. But Paris does not necessarily have to be a city that sucks all the money out of pockets and bank accounts. Paris isn’t cheap,
        but it isn’t more expensive than other European cities. In fact, visiting London or Amsterdam will cost you way more money. </p>
    <h3>Stay in central location</h3>
    <p>Pinning down the perfect place to stay depends on budget and location, but quite often the second one is way more important as you think. Paris is
        divided into 20 neighborhoods or arrondissements and everything is being referred to 12th, 18th, etc.
        Before booking your hotel check whether the area is safe and close to the places you want to visit. If you’re in Paris for a very limited time don’t
        choose a place on the edge of town, as you definitely don’t want to spend hours on commuting in order to save a few bucks.
        During my last visit I had a chance to stay at Le Roch Hotel & Spa and it was the best possible choice. The hotel was right next to the Louvre,
        2 minutes walk from a pick-up point for many tours, and close to major metro stations. While Paris hotels are usually known for being cramped and
        tiny, my room was spacious and I even had a big bath tub.
        The hotel was small which made the staff more attentive and helpful. Its decor made me feel like I’m in a chic apartment with a spa and not in an
        actual hotel. I actually had a chance to eat dinner there as well and I can’t recommend it enough.</p>
    <h3>Buy a museum pass as Paris has way more to offer than just Louvre</h3>
    <p>The museum pass isn’t only going to save you money, but also time. You won’t need to stand in the long line to every museum and you could skip the
        ticket line at both Versailles and the Louvre – the longest lines to wait in. If you want to include other attractions in your pass you could look
        up Paris Pass.</p>
</div>

<div id="attractions" class="container text-center">
    <h1>Attractions</h1>
    <h3>Scale the Eiffel Tower</h3>
    <p>The most famous edifice in the world, the Eiffel Tower, was originally erected as a temporary exhibit for a World Fair. It provides heart-stopping
        views over Paris and is visible from most vantage points across the city. Apart from the new glass floor installed in 2014, there’s also a panoramic
        champagne bar on the third floor, a brasserie, and the Michelin-starred Jules Verne restaurant. At night, the Eiffel’s girders sparkle like fairy
        lights on a Christmas tree (every hour, on the hour).</p>
    <h3>Get lost in Louvre</h3>
    <p>A behemoth of a museum, the Louvre has galleries and wings so vast you could easily spend a day feasting your eyes on treasures like the Mona Lisa,
        the Venus de Milo and Egyptian mummies – not to mention on the building itself, which sports sumptuous architecture erected and remodelled over the
        centuries by the rulers of France. When cultural overload sets in, take a breather in the Café Mollien at the top of the grand Mollien staircase.
        This is one Paris attraction you need to do at least once. </p>
    <h3>Be impressed by the Musée d'Orsay</h3>
    <p>The old Belle Époque Orsay train station was converted into the Musée D’Orsay in 1986 to house one of the world’s largest collections of Impressionist
        and Post-impressionist art. Aside from works by Monet, Renoir, Van Gogh and Toulouse-Lautrec, you'll find a dapper collection of decorative arts from
        the Art Nouveau era and a wide range of 19th-century sculpture. Digest it over coffee in the café behind the museum’s giant transparent clock.</p>
    <h3>Going underground to the Catacombs of Paris</h3>
    <p>The Paris Catacombs are open every day but Monday from 10am – 8pm and last admission is at 7pm.
        Entrance to the Paris Catacombs costs €10 and apparently, you can now buy your tickets in advance though I am not sure if this saves you the long
        wait in line to actually get in. Visit this page to see if you qualify for a reduced fare.
        There can only be a maximum of 200 people inside the tunnels at any given time. Combine this with the fact that you cannot book tickets in advance
        and what you get is a perpetual queue throughout the day. If you don’t want to wait hours in line (and I mean hours), get here at the very least
        45 minutes before opening. This is the biggest tip when it comes to visiting the Catacombs.
        The temperature down in the Catacombs is a constant 14 degrees and it can be a bit damp down there. Dress accordingly with a few layers and proper shoes.
        Getting to the Paris Catacombs is super easy by Metro. Simply get off at the Denfert-Rochereau and you’ll exit right at the entrance.</p>

    <div id="weather" class="container text-center">
        <h1>Weather</h1>
    <p>Paris has a temperate oceanic climate, but the city is known for its unexpected rain showers which can occur at any time of year. Spring, from March to
    May, is the driest season in Paris but rainfall is distributed fairly evenly throughout the other seasons. It is best to have an umbrella with you in Paris
    no matter what the season, but the rain showers are usually as brief as they are sudden. Snow is rare but the city does usually get a smattering in the
    winter months (December to February). Summer (June to August) temperatures are mild to warm, with average highs of 77°F (25°C) and occasional heat waves,
    while winters are very chilly with temperatures hovering around freezing point. The average temperatures in Paris generally range between 41°F (5°C)
    during winter and 68°F (20°C) in summer. July is the hottest month of the year, although August can be almost as hot, and January is the coldest.
    November through January can be a little windy but generally wind is not a problem in Paris.
    </p>

<div id="transport" class="container text-center">
    <h1>Public Transport</h1>
    <p>Almost all of the Paris public transport system is run by the RATP (Régie Autonome des Transports Parisiens; 08 92 69 32 46, www.ratp.fr): the bus,
        métro (underground) and suburban tram routes, as well as lines A and B of the RER (Réseau Express Régional) suburban express railway, which connects
        with the métro within the city centre. National rail operator SNCF (08 92 35 35 35, www.sncf.com) runs RER lines C, D and E, and serves the Paris
        suburbs (Banlieue), and French regions and abroad (Grandes Lignes).</p>
       <p> Paris and suburbs are divided into six travel zones; zones 1 and 2 cover the city centre. RATP tickets and passes are valid on the métro, bus and RER.
        Tickets and carnets can be bought at métro stations, tourist offices and tabacs (tobacconists); single tickets can also be bought on buses. Hold on
           to your ticket in case of spot checks; you’ll also need it to exit from RER stations.</p>
        <h3>Fares and tickets</h3>
    <p>A single ticket T+ costs €1.90, but it’s more economical to buy a carnet of ten for €14.50.
        A one-day Mobilis pass costs from €7.30 for zones 1 and 2 to €17.30 for zones 1-5 (not including airports).
        A one-day Paris Visite pass for zones 1-3 is €11.65; a five-day pass is €37.25, with discounts on some attractions.
        One-week or one-month Navigo pass (passport photo needed) offer unlimited travel in the relevant zones and is delivered as a Navigo swipe card.
        A forfait mensuel (valid from the first day of the month) for all zones costs €73; a weekly forfait hebdomadaire (weekly Carte Orange valid Mon-Sun
        inclusive) for all zones costs €22.15 and is better value than Paris Visite passes.</p>
